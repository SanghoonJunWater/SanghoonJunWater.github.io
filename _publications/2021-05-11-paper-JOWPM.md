## Abstract
Cyanobacterial blooms are expected to be more frequent over time as more favourable environmental conditions are created in a warming climate. This study proposes strategies to effectively mitigate/reduce the concentration of cyanobacterial blooms based on a probabilistic modelling. The model adopted in this study is a probabilistic forecasting model of cyanobacteria cell counts that uses two dominant variables contributing to cyanobacterial bloom namely, water temperature (T) and water velocity (V) in a river. Both T and V can be manipulated by controlling the upstream flow in the river by altering reservoir operation thereby changing water release downstream. We test and evaluate a variety of discharge scenarios in two river systems in South Korea. Our findings suggest that releasing cold dam water is quite effective to suppress cyanobacterial blooms growth. As a next step we extend the analysis, by also including the cost of each operation and conduct a cost benefit analysis. Following this, we propose response scenarios for each river system by which optimal proactive actions can be taken according to the river conditions given.
